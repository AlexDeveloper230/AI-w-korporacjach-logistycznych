# A42 — AI-Driven Corporate Coaching System for Logistics

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a proprietary project developed under the **A42** brand, focused on the design, analysis, and structured documentation of an **AI-driven corporate coaching and training system** dedicated to **logistics and operational organisations**.

The project applies recognised **project management, quality management, and strategic analysis frameworks** (ISO 9001, PMI PMBOK, TQM) to a real-world use case:  
**automating knowledge creation, validation, and dissemination in complex logistics environments**.

This repository represents a **pre-commercial, academic–strategic artefact** and forms the foundation for potential future productisation (B2B, SaaS, licensing), subject to explicit authorisation.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of the project is to:

- design a **scalable, AI-supported corporate training ecosystem**,
- reduce dependency on manual coaching and individual trainers,
- standardise operational knowledge (SOPs),
- support continuous improvement and quality management,
- enable controlled scalability across multiple locations and processes.

Secondary objectives include:

- alignment with **ISO 9001:2015 quality principles**,
- compliance with **PMI PMBOK project governance**,
- demonstrable academic completeness suitable for formal evaluation,
- protection and consolidation of intellectual property.

## Project Scope

The repository documents the project across the full lifecycle, including:

- business background and problem diagnosis,
- stakeholder identification and analysis,
- strategic and operational goals,
- SWOT analysis with weighted scoring and MINI–MAXI strategy,
- PESTEL macro-environment analysis with quantified impact,
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS),
- responsibility matrices (RASCIT),
- scheduling concepts (Gantt, dependencies, milestones),
- risk identification and mitigation logic,
- quality, governance, and compliance considerations.

**Out of scope**:
- production-grade software code,
- live AI models,
- operational deployment in client environments,
- long-term system maintenance.
